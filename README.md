### Background

I wanted a quick way to visualize some data which is stored in a simple text file.
I initiall created some scripts in R which generated graphs but tended to be a two 
step process of creating the graph and then opening the generated graph. 

I did some graphing using gnuplot, but X11 would never be started so it took time to start.
So after seeing [command-line sparklines](https://github.com/holman/spark)
I figured I could do the same thing using block characters for bar charts.



### Usage

Create a `termgraph` on the command line or through the API.

* Command line

  - Create data file with two columns either comma or space separated. The first column is your labels, the second column is a numeric data

  - Run thepython termgraph.py [datafile]

* `TermGraph` API
  
   Create a `TermGraph` object by specifying the labels, data and (optionally) the graph width:
   
    `termgraph = TermGraph(labels = ['a', 'b'], data = [1, 2], width = width)`

   Call the `render()` method to output the graph: 
   
    `termgraph.render()`


### TODO
I may or may not ever get around to these TODOs but a few ideas to take it further

* Add switch for vertical bar charts
* Add options for different colors
* Stacked Bar Charts
* Multiple series (side-by-side)


#### Release Info

* Ver 0.2 - Sep 22, 2012 
  - Add width parameter 

* Ver 0.1 - Sep 21, 2012 - Initial Horizontal Graphs
